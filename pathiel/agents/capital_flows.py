"""Deposits and withdrawals, so the drawdown number stops lying.

The problem this fixes: nothing in this repo recorded capital moving in or out,
so an equity curve could not tell a trading loss from the operator withdrawing
USDC. The risk panel read peak $225.93 against $0.03 today and had to label that
an "equity decline" rather than a loss, because it genuinely did not know which
it was. A number that cannot distinguish those two is not a risk metric.

Two pieces:

  RECORD — `record_flows()` pulls Hyperliquid's non-funding ledger (deposits,
  withdrawals, and transfers crossing the pool boundary) and appends them to a
  JSONL under the state dir. Idempotent by event key, so re-running it over an
  overlapping window never double-counts. The heavy lifting of classifying a
  transfer already lives in client.hl_client.fetch_aggregate_contributions_since;
  this module owns persistence and the time series.

  MEASURE — `nav_series()` converts an equity curve plus those flows into a
  flow-neutral NAV index. This is a time-weighted return: between two equity
  observations the return is (equity_now - net_flow) / equity_before, and the
  index compounds those. Depositing $100 does not move the index, which is
  exactly the property the drawdown needs.

Why time-weighted and not simply subtracting cumulative flows: subtraction gives
a dollar figure that still moves when capital moves, so a withdrawal would still
print as a drawdown. Only an index that normalises each interval by the capital
actually at risk during it is flow-neutral.
