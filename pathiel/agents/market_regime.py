"""Per-asset-class market regime detection — feeds the market_regime risk gate.

Classifies each coin into crypto / equity / commodity, then picks the right
trend proxy:

  crypto    -> BTC 1h trend (crypto beta proxy)
  equity    -> the coin's own 1h trend, falling back to xyz:SP500 when the
               own series is thin/neutral
  commodity -> the coin's own 1h trend (commodities aren't correlated to each
               other; gas, silver, copper, oil all move on their own drivers)

Trend itself is EMA20 vs EMA50 on 1h closes, with a short slope check on the
fast EMA so we don't whipsaw at the cross. Three states: 'up', 'down',
'neutral' (no strong direction → gate stays out of the way).

Regimes are cached per-proxy for `REGIME_TTL_S` (default 5 min) so the gate
doesn't re-fetch candles for every trade attempt in a scan cycle.
