"""Unified shadow-mode ledger.

Every shadow book (default-off / `shadow_only:true` strategy) records its
candidate signals HERE instead of inventing its own jsonl. That gives one
organized, checkable home for shadow data:

    <state_dir>/shadow_ledger/<book>.jsonl   (one record per candidate signal)

A record is a normalized, side-aware, forward-gradeable snapshot:

    {v, ts, book, coin, side, signal_bar_t, entry_ref_px, horizon_days, stop_pct, meta}

`scripts/shadow_status.py` is the single handler that inventories every book
and forward-grades the resolved signals (fetch realized bars, simulate the exact
side/stop/horizon exit, report EV + OOS halves). No book grades itself anymore.

This module does ZERO trading. It only appends/reads jsonl + runs a pure-Python
exit simulation with the candle fetch injected (so it is unit-testable offline).

    - VALIDATED : mean@12bps > 0 AND both OOS halves > 0 AND still > 0 at 25bps.
    - MARGINAL  : positive @12bps but dies by 25bps or one OOS half is weak/negative.
    - REFUTED   : non-positive @12bps (the edge is not there forward).

    `VERDICT_FEE_TIER` is the single definition of "12bps" here.
    scripts/autonomous_cycle.py demotes on the same tier. Until 2026-08-30 it
    demoted on slip6 instead, so a book at slip6 +0.2% / slip12 -0.1% read
    REFUTED on the dashboard while the loop left it live — the dashboard saying
    the edge was gone and the capital staying on it anyway.

    Promotion never disagreed: since slip25 <= slip12 <= slip6, requiring
    survival at 25bps already implies a positive 12bps read.
