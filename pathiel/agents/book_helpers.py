"""Shared scaffolding for the "books" — the per-thesis modules under
pathiel/agents/ that each poll a signal, record it to the shared shadow
ledger, and (once forward-validated) open a bounded live order through the
executor.

Split out 2026-08-30 (agent 1/8, dedup pass) after finding the exact same
handful of tiny functions copy-pasted byte-for-byte across `news_surge_multi.py`,
`news_surge_short_live.py`, `social_trending_recorder.py`, `unlock_short_live.py`,
`unlock_recorder.py`:

- `execute_opened` / `execute_block_detail` — parse whatever `_book_execute`
  (scripts/trading_loop.py) / `executor.maybe_execute` returned.
- `load_seen` / `save_seen` — a per-"coin:day"-key dedup timestamp file, so a
  book doesn't re-open the same signal twice in one day.
- `last_pass_ms` / `mark_pass` — a scan-interval throttle timestamp file.
- `load_state` / `save_state` — the same read-whole-dict/write-whole-dict
  pattern as the two above, but for an untyped state blob instead of a
  str->int map (CoinGecko trending's poll clock, the unlock calendar cache).
- `safe_float` — cast-or-zero, the same 4 lines that were showing up under
  three different private names (`_num`, `_num`, `_f`).
- `bounded_exit_override` — the exact `dsl_exit_override` dict every one of
  the reverse-refuted/validated live books sends: a hard %/ROE stop, no
  partial take-profit, no breakeven ratchet, no ATR stop, no noise band. Only
  the stop width, leverage, and timeout differ book-to-book, so those stay
  each book's own responsibility; this returns just the resulting shape.

Every function here is pure (or does its own best-effort file I/O with the
book's own failure semantics preserved exactly — see each docstring). Zero
dependency on anything else in pathiel/agents: a leaf module, the same
shape as atomic_io.py and client/http_session.py, so importing it from any
book cannot create an import cycle.
