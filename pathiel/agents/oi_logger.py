"""Open-interest time-series logger. HL exposes only CURRENT OI (metaAndAssetCtxs /
get_universe's `openInterest`), no history — so to ever backtest the OI/price four-quadrant
positioning filter we must self-collect a time-series going forward. This APPENDS a
snapshot each call.
Throttled + size-capped so it's cheap and bounded. Piggybacks the universe the loop
already fetches — no extra API calls.
