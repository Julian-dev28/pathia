"""Which markets this system is allowed to look at, in one place.

2026-08-29 (operator decision): the tradable universe is restricted to majors.
The reason is capacity, not edge. The activity audit put 94% of missed moves
down to capital saturation, and the illiquid tail is where slippage eats a
thesis before the thesis is wrong. Majors buy clean fills, honest backtests,
and enough depth that sizing stops being the binding constraint.

Stated plainly so nobody mistakes it for alpha: this is a UNIVERSE
RESTRICTION, not a strategy. Majors are the most efficient, most arbitraged
markets that exist. Restricting to them removes a leak. It does not create an
edge, and no result measured here should be read as if it did.

Matching is by BARE ticker — the HIP-3 dex prefix is stripped — so one entry
covers `GOLD`, `xyz:GOLD`, and `km:GOLD` alike. This mirrors
market_regime.classify_asset, which resolves the same way and for the same
reason: HIP-3 venues are mixed, and the prefix says where a market is listed,
not what it is.
