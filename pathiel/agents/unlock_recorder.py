"""Unlock calendar + the run-in signal token-unlock recorder (W-U lane, 2026-07-11).

Scheduled supply unlocks are the one news type knowable IN ADVANCE: DefiLlama
publishes the cliff calendar, so "unlock in <=24h" is a point-in-time-safe
signal with no scraping race. This module records hypothetical SHORTs to the
unified shadow ledger ahead of unlocks >= min_pct_circ of circulating supply.
Nothing here trades; promotion runs through scripts/shadow_status.py
(>=30 episodes, EV25>0 both halves) exactly like every other recorder.

W-U1 backtest evidence (research/alpha_swarm/hypotheses/W-U1_results.json,
915 events, 90 HL coins, 2026-07-11): the registered T-1d->T+2d short earned
+0.76%/trade net but p_mc=0.10 with a SIGN FLIP across halves (-0.24 / +1.76)
— NOT validated. The robust exploratory fact: price falls -2.1% close-to-close
over T-3d->T (n=408, win 39.5%) and the drop is DONE by the event (post
T->T+3d ~= 0). Hence TWO forward arms, both zero-capital, forward data
adjudicates: ``unlock_short_runin`` enters in the [72h,48h) pre-unlock window
(rides the run-in), ``unlock_short`` enters inside the last 24h (the
registered cell).

Calendar source: the free DefiLlama open-datasets bucket (the api.llama.fi
emissions endpoints went paid). The 21MB index is refreshed at most every
``refresh_hours`` (default 12) and reduced immediately to a tiny upcoming-
events state file; a failed refresh keeps the stale calendar (unlock dates
don't move on that timescale).
