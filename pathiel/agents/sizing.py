"""Risk-first position sizing — the Turtle "N" / Larry Hite / Ed Seykota school.

PURE FUNCTIONS ONLY. No network, no config reads, no side effects — so they are
trivially testable and carry zero live impact until a caller wires them in.

The live executor does NOT call this module — its ATR-equal-risk branch was
ripped out 2026-07-09 (it had been gated off since the 429-amplification
incident; live sizing is equity × fraction × leverage, the DSL stop bounds
the loss). These pure functions survive for `scripts/backtest_logged.py` and
`scripts/strategy_grid_search.py`, which use them to explore an equal-risk
sizing basis offline: size so that, if the configured stop is hit, the loss
is a fixed fraction of equity, then clamp by exchange leverage and notional
caps.
