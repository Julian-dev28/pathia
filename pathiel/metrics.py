"""Prometheus metrics for the trading agent.

The `/metrics` endpoint (served by `server.py`) is scraped by Prometheus. It is
deliberately **network-free**: every gauge is refreshed from local state only
(`memory`, the agent config, and the cross-process positions snapshot the loop
writes each cycle), so a scrape never hits Hyperliquid and never contends with
the loop's rate limiter. Process/GC collectors are auto-registered by
prometheus_client on import (they populate on Linux — i.e. in the container/k8s,
which is where the ops signal matters).
