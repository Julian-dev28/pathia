"""Token-bucket rate limiter for the Hyperliquid /info + /exchange endpoints.

HL allows ~1200 request-weight per minute per IP. Different endpoints cost
different weight (candleSnapshot=20, allMids=2, etc.). Previously the scan
loop paced itself with a crude fixed `time.sleep(0.3)` between batches, which
either left throughput on the table or — during backtests / dense scans —
fired straight into 429s (200+ "no candles" skips observed).

A single shared bucket meters every outbound request by its weight, so bursts
are smoothed against the real per-minute budget regardless of which code path
(live scan, dashboard, backtest, treasury) is making the call.

# NOTE: this bucket is PER-PROCESS, but HL limits per-IP. The live loop and
# dashboard server are separate processes sharing one IP, so neither sees the
# other's usage. Still, each process must respect the documented budget. A live
# scan legitimately bursts ~50 candleSnapshot calls (weight ~= 1000) then sleeps;
# the refill stays at 1200 weight/min, while the burst cap is large enough that
# those workers queue instead of timing out and producing fake candle gaps.
# Sized so loop + server FIT the per-IP budget (audit 2026-07-10: the old
# 600cap+20/s loop plus 200cap+5/s server allowed 2,300 weight/min against
# HL's 1,200 — the limiter never braked while the exchange returned 522 real
# 429s/14d). Loop: 300 burst + 15/s = 900/min sustained; server (restart.sh
# env) gets 60 burst + 2/s = 120/min. Combined ~1,020/min, margin for the SDK
# calls that bypass this bucket.
