# Install deps first so `pip install` is cached across code changes. hatchling

# version from __init__.py) to resolve the full dependency set — including
# `requests` and `websocket-client`, which pyproject.toml never lists
# directly but which land anyway as transitive deps of hyperliquid-python-sdk
# (verified 2026-08-29: `pip show hyperliquid-python-sdk` -> Requires:
# eth-account, eth-utils, msgpack, requests, websocket-client). No compiler
# needed on this base image — every dependency ships a manylinux wheel.

#                                (imported by every process below)
#   scripts/                    trading_loop.py, scheduler.py, log_rotate.py,

# artifacts — nothing under pathiel/scripts/services imports it at

# ── Runtime state ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# State lives on a persistent volume mounted at /data (fly.toml [[mounts]] /
# k8s volumeClaimTemplates) so the loop, server, scheduler, and rotator all
# share one source of truth across restarts and redeploys.
#
# Almost every state path in this app routes through PATHIEL_STATE_DIR (see
# pathiel/agents/rebalancer_owned.py:state_file — the claims registry,
# per-strategy timers, and pathiel/agents/shadow_ledger.py's
# <state>/shadow_ledger/<book>.jsonl all resolve relative to it; also
# services/trend_engine/env.py).
# Pointing that ONE var at /data/.state redirects all of them together.
#
# scripts/scheduler.py's own job-run bookkeeping (.state/scheduler.json —
# last_run per job, so a restart doesn't refire every job's catch-up logic
# and burn its LLM/API budget) is the one holdout: it hardcodes
# `<repo root>/.state` at import time and does not read PATHIEL_STATE_DIR.
# scripts/scheduler.py is out of this workstream's ownership (belongs to the
# supervision workstream), so the fix lives here instead: a symlink that
# makes its hardcoded path resolve onto the same volume. docker-entrypoint.sh
# creates the real /data/.state directory at container start (the volume is
# empty/fresh at that point, not at image-build time, so it can't be created
# here). If scheduler.py is ever made PATHIEL_STATE_DIR-aware, this symlink
# becomes a no-op and can be deleted.

# pathiel/server.py defaults PATHIEL_BIND to 127.0.0.1 (a 2026-07-10
# security fix for running bare on an operator's Mac, so the dashboard isn't
# reachable from the LAN by default). Inside a container that default makes
# the process unreachable from anywhere OUTSIDE its own network namespace —
# `docker run -p`, Fly's http_service checks, and k8s probes/Services all
# connect from outside it, so the request never lands and every health check
# times out. 0.0.0.0 is correct and safe here: the container/pod boundary is
# the actual security perimeter (Fly's edge proxy / the k8s Service), not the
# loopback interface.

# LOCALLY AUTHENTICATED Claude Code CLI session (an operator's desktop
# subscription — not a credential that can be baked into an image or passed
# as a secret) and cannot run in a stateless cloud container as configured;
# see DEPLOY.md "AI provider" for the tradeoff and what still degrades
# gracefully (services/trend_engine/ai.py's narrative pass) vs. what needs
# openrouter to function at all (the Polymarket forecaster's default path).
