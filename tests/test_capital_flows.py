"""Gate tests for capital-flow accounting.

The defect these close: an equity curve alone cannot tell a trading loss from
the operator withdrawing USDC. The risk panel read peak $225.93 against $0.03
and had to call it "an equity decline" because it genuinely did not know which
it was. A number that cannot separate those two is not a risk metric.

The fix is a time-weighted NAV index. These tests pin the property that makes it
work — capital moving in or out must not move the index — and pin the honesty
fallback for windows the flow record does not cover.
