"""The funded dry run must be honest at every equity, especially the awkward ones.

The account cannot trade, so the question "would these books actually trade,
and with what" has never been answered by running them. This report answers it
from config and the books' own ledgers. Its whole value is being right about
the partial cases — the ones where some books work and some do not — because
that is where an operator makes a funding decision.
