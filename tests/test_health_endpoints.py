"""Health that means something.

/api/health answered {"status": "running"} unconditionally, and both fly.toml
and k8s/statefulset.yaml pointed probes at it. A dead trading loop behind a live
web process therefore read as perfectly healthy to every monitor — the same
silent-failure shape as a data outage reading as a quiet market, or an unrotated
log filling a disk until the box stops.

The split matters as much as the check:
  /api/health         LIVENESS of the web process. Always 200 if it can serve.
  /api/health/system  Is the SYSTEM working. 503 when it is not.

A liveness probe that failed because the trading loop died would restart the web
container, which fixes nothing and destroys the dashboard that is the only way
to see what happened.
