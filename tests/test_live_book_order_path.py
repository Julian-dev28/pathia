"""The four live books, exercised together through the real machinery.

These four place real bounded orders. Three of them were rewired on 2026-08-30
and one (`social_trending`) had its live arm written that day, so none had ever
produced an order in its current wiring. Two of them —  news_surge_short and
news_surge_multi — trade THE SAME underlying signal (a breaking coverage surge),
differing only in how many firehoses measure it, so they can fire on the same
coin from the same event.

Per the standing rule that integration beats mocks for anything touching shared
state: everything here uses a real tmp_path-backed ClaimsRegistry, never a
double.
