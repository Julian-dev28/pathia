"""Gate tests for scripts/scheduler.py — the only scheduler that runs on this
box (cron and launchd are TCC-dead, see the module docstring).

Offline and deterministic: every job is an injected `runner`, no subprocess and
no clock beyond an explicit `now`. What is covered:

  schedule math   catch-up after the lid was shut, fixed-grid intervals
  concurrency     a slow job cannot starve a cheap one, and cannot stack
  bookkeeping     `last_run` is claimed at START, outcomes never clobber
                  each other, and a failing job never ends the pass
