"""Gate tests for the risk panel (2026-08-29).

Why this exists: the landing page counted 45 mentions of pnl and 25 of equity
and ZERO of drawdown, fee drag, or win rate. It showed upside and activity and
never once showed what the account could lose. These tests pin the numbers a
person with money actually asks for, and — just as important — pin the honesty
caveat, because a drawdown number that quietly counts a withdrawal as a loss is
worse than no number at all.
