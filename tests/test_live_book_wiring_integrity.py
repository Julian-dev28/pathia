Two kinds of check live here:

# executor.py:1023 clamps the on-exchange backup stop to
#   entry * (backup_sl_max_frac_of_liq / leverage)
# so a book whose configured stop_pct exceeds 60/leverage percent NEVER
# executes the stop it advertises — the clamp silently substitutes a tighter
# one, and the book's DSL max_loss_pct becomes dead weight (it sits beyond
# both the real stop AND liquidation at 100/leverage percent). That is the
# rally_exhaustion lesson in a different costume: the live stop width is not
# the graded stop width, and a tight live stop can invert a validated edge.
#
# The reverse-refuted books were re-graded at their TRUE clamped width before
# going live (+10.59%/sig news_surge_short, +6.09%/sig mover_pass_short, both
# OOS halves positive) — this test pins that their config keeps telling the
# truth. The six older fixed-notional books all predate this check and are
