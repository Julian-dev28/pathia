"""Gate tests for the majors universe restriction (2026-08-29).

The restriction has to bind in THREE places or it is theatre:
  1. the scan, so the candle + AI budget is not spent on untradable markets
  2. the risk gate, so a book cannot route around the scan
  3. the loop's own entry-block reason, which is a separate code path

These tests pin all three, plus the bare-ticker matching that lets one entry
cover every HIP-3 venue's prefix for the same underlying.
