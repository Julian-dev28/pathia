"""What a funded account would actually do — checked before money is at risk.

W-FUND1 simulated funding and found two things that would otherwise have been
discovered by funding the account and watching it sit idle:

  1. the majors allowlist blocks 92-100% of every live book's historical
     signals, and 100% of unlock_short_runin's
  2. the $25 dust floor supports ONE of four books; all four need $88.89

A book that is live, validated, and structurally unable to fire is the shadow
state wearing a live badge — and it is invisible from inside the code.
