"""Gate test for the deploy config: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, fly.toml, and
k8s/statefulset.yaml.

This is the test that would have caught `services/` going missing from a
3-months-stale Dockerfile (the app grew services/trend_engine and
after the last deploy-config touch; the Dockerfile never learned about it).
It works by NOT hardcoding the expected package
list — it statically scans every import under pathia/, scripts/, and
services/ for `import services.<x>` / `from services.<x> import ...` /
`from pathia...`, then asserts the Dockerfile actually COPYs each
referenced top-level package. Add a new services/<name> package and start
importing it from the app, and this test fails on the next commit until the
Dockerfile is updated to match — same mechanism that would have caught the
original staleness.

The process side works the same way in reverse: scripts/restart.sh defines
one `<NAME>_PATTERN` string per managed process (used for `pgrep -f`, so
they're already designed to be a distinctive substring of that process's
real command line). This test asserts every one of those patterns shows up
in both fly.toml's [processes] table and k8s/statefulset.yaml's containers,
so a process restart.sh gains (or loses) can't silently drift out of sync
with either deploy target.

Deterministic, offline (no docker, no network, no subprocess), <2s.
