"""Every log sink is bounded, and the two rotation paths never overlap.

Two mechanisms exist and they are mutually exclusive by construction:

  external copytruncate (scripts/log_rotate.py) — the only thing that can bound
  a file a process appends to through a shell `nohup >>` redirection, because
  the process never reopens that fd.

  in-process RotatingFileHandler (pathiel.log_setup.configure_logging) —
  correct only for a process whose stdout/stderr are NOT already being appended
  to the same path externally.

Using both on one file would double-log and let the handler rename a file the
shell fd still points at. This pins that no entrypoint does that, and that the
rotator's glob actually covers every sink, so a new log file added later is
bounded automatically rather than growing forever unnoticed.
