"""Every first-party import hidden behind `except Exception` must actually work.

A local import inside a broad try/except is a normal pattern here — metrics,
health checks and optional lanes all use it so one broken source degrades one
value instead of blanking a whole endpoint. The cost is that an ImportError
inside the guard is indistinguishable from the failure the guard is FOR.

That is not hypothetical. pathiel/metrics.py imported
`pathiel.agents.paths`, a module that has never existed. The guard caught
the ImportError and set the "never ran" sentinel, so pathiel_supervisor_age_seconds
and pathiel_alert_eval_age_seconds read 1e6 on a live box whose supervisor had
run 74 seconds earlier — and the test covering them asserted the sentinel, so it
passed. The bug was found by reading the live scrape.

97 guarded imports today. This resolves every one.
