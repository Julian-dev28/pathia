"""The pre-commit gate CLAUDE.md always claimed existed.

CLAUDE.md has said "Gate tests — run on every commit via pre-commit hook" since
the project started. No hook existed until 2026-08-29, so nothing was gating
anything and the claim was simply false. These tests keep it true.

The hook lives in scripts/hooks/ and is wired through core.hooksPath rather than
being copied into .git/hooks, so it is version-controlled, reviewable in a diff,
and survives a fresh clone.
