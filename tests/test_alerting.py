"""Alerts for the failures, not the happy path.

Every existing metric — equity, open positions, unrealized PnL — measures a
WORKING system. None of them move when it breaks, which is how a dead trading
loop, a blind market feed, and an unrotated disk each went unnoticed for weeks.

Each alert below corresponds to a silent failure this system has actually had,
and each has a metric behind it that is exported for real.
