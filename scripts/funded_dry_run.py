"""What happens the moment this account is funded? Answer it before funding it.

The trading loop is running, the books are live, and the executor refuses every
order because equity is under the structural floor. That means the interesting
question — would these books actually trade, and with what — has never been
answered by running them. This answers it deterministically, from the same
config the executor reads and the same forward ledgers the books wrote, without
invoking the order path at all.

Deliberately NOT a call into `executor.maybe_execute`: mode is LIVE, so driving
the real entry point to "simulate" would place real orders. Nothing here
touches the exchange.
