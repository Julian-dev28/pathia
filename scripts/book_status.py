"""Where each live book stands against the promotion bar. No network.

The full grader (scripts/autonomous_cycle.py) needs forward candles from
Hyperliquid to produce a verdict, so it cannot answer anything while the
exchange is down — which is exactly when someone wants to know where things
stand. This answers the part that needs no network: how many signals each book
has recorded, whether it clears the evidence floor, and whether the evidence
loop can actually switch it.
