"""Where state lives, and how a standalone script finds it. One definition.

Three scripts got this wrong in three different ways in a single session:

  - The supervisor, the alert evaluator and restart.sh hardcoded <root>/.state,
    which equals the live PATHIEL_STATE_DIR and nothing else. The metrics reader
    used state_file(). Under the test env they pointed at different trees and
    each side looked correct alone.
  - backup_state.py resolved PATHIEL_STATE_DIR without loading .env.local, so a
    hand-run wrote its receipt to the repo root while preflight_live.py — which
    does load it — reported "backup never run" thirty seconds after a
    successful backup.

The rule is the same everywhere and it is worth exactly one implementation:
load .env.local, then PATHIEL_STATE_DIR, else the project root. It matches
pathiel.agents.rebalancer_owned.state_file(), which is what the running
system uses, and tests/test_supervisor.py pins the two together.

Deliberately dependency-free: these scripts run as scheduler subprocesses and
must not need the agents package imported to find a file.
