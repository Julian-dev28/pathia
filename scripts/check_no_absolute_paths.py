"""Fail if any tracked Python file hardcodes an absolute path into a home dir.

This repo's CI was red on every push for weeks while the suite was green
locally. The cause was 50 files carrying
`REPO = "/Users/julian_dev/Documents/code/pathiel"`. Nothing caught it,
because on the one machine that mattered the path existed.

Deterministic and offline, so it runs as the first CI step: when it fails, the
error names the real problem instead of surfacing as a FileNotFoundError
several minutes into the suite.
