"""Restart pathiel processes that have died. Run by the scheduler, every 2 min.

Why this exists
---------------
`trading_loop.py` already self-heals when it HANGS: a watchdog thread re-execs
the process if no scan completes inside `PATHIEL_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_S`. That
covers a live-but-wedged loop. It cannot cover a loop that is GONE — OOM, a
SIGKILL, a closed terminal, the Mac sleeping. Nothing restarted those, and the
cost is on record: a full week of no trading in June, diagnosed after the fact
as "the Mac was asleep".

The obvious fix is launchd, and launchd does not work here. macOS TCC denies
launchd (and cron) access to ~/Documents, so a job defined there never runs and
never says why — which is exactly how the plist ended up renamed `.disabled`.
The scheduler is already a plain process started from a granted terminal, so it
already has the access launchd cannot get. Supervision belongs there.

Two rules keep this from being worse than the problem:

1. The operator always wins. `restart.sh stoploop` is the kill switch; a
   supervisor that restarts the loop two minutes later has silently deleted it.
   Every stop-and-stay-stopped action writes its component to
   `.state/supervisor_halt.json`, every start clears it, and a halted component
   is never restarted here.

2. A crash loop is a bug, not a thing to paper over. If a component needs more
   than MAX_RESTARTS inside RESTART_WINDOW_S it is left down and reported.
   Restarting a process that dies on startup forever would just hide the
   traceback that explains it.

The scheduler itself is deliberately NOT supervised: this runs as its child, so
restarting it would kill the process doing the restarting.

    introduced a worse one: when the trading loop starts the scheduler, the loop
    is transiently the scheduler's ancestor, so the scheduler's first supervisor
    pass subtracted the loop's pid, concluded the loop was DOWN, and restarted a
    perfectly healthy trading loop mid-scan (2026-08-31 08:22:56, on record in
