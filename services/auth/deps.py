"""FastAPI dependencies. The only way a route learns who is calling.

Two audiences, one door:

  a browser        carries an httpOnly session cookie set by the SIWE flow
  a script or CLI  carries `Authorization: Bearer <session token>`

Both resolve to the same `User`, so no route has to care which it got.

The legacy `PATHIEL_OPERATOR_TOKEN` still works and is still checked in
`pathiel.dashboard._require_operator`. It is a shared, static, per-deployment
secret: fine for one operator on one box, useless the moment there is more than
one human, because it cannot say who acted. It is retained for the machine paths
(the scheduler, the supervisor, smoke checks) and is not a login.
