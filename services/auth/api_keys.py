"""API keys, owned by the wallet that minted them.

THE CONTRACT, AND WHY IT IS SQL AND NOT AN IMPORT
--------------------------------------------------
`services/pathiel_data_api` authenticates every request against an `api_keys`
table. It is its own deploy unit with its own Dockerfile and its own
requirements, none of which are installed in the trading image — so importing
its SQLAlchemy models from here would fail at runtime even if the source were
copied in. `test_dockerfile_does_not_bundle_pathiel_data_api` exists to keep that
boundary, and it caught exactly this mistake on the first attempt.

So the contract between the two services is the thing they genuinely share: the
table, its column names, and the rule that a token is looked up by
`sha256(raw).hexdigest()`. This module speaks to it in plain SQL, the same way
`services/auth/store.py` speaks to the session tables. Neither service imports
the other.

That contract is asserted, not assumed:
`test_the_two_services_still_hash_a_token_the_same_way` checks both sides agree,
because if they ever drift a customer mints a key that opens nothing and neither
service logs a thing.

WHAT THE TABLE GAINED
---------------------
One column, `owner_address`. Without it a key belonged to the deployment rather
than a person, so nothing could answer "which keys are mine", "revoke that one",
or "this customer stopped paying".

WHY THE RAW KEY IS SHOWN EXACTLY ONCE
-------------------------------------
Only the hash is stored, so nobody, us included, can recover a key after
minting. A leaked database yields no usable credential. It also means "show me
my key again" is not a feature that can exist, and the caller has to say so at
the moment of minting rather than leaving it to be discovered.

Keys are prefixed `pk_live_` so one in a log, a paste or a public repository is
recognisable at a glance and greppable by a secret scanner.
