"""Signal resources — first-party computed signals + licensed-data adapter slots.

Two kinds of resource live here, and the distinction is the whole point:

1. Signals we compute ourselves from our OWN upstream data (Hyperliquid candles
   via `hl_resource`). `our_momentum_signal` is a real example — trailing return
   from HL closes. We can serve these because we own the inputs and the math.

2. Licensed-data adapter SLOTS. `net_flow` is options-flow data that requires the
   OPRA options tape, a licensed feed we do not have. We do NOT reproduce a
   competitor's proprietary tape or fabricate numbers. Unconfigured, the slot
   returns `None` so the router answers 501 honestly; configured-but-not-yet-
   wired, it raises `NotImplementedError` rather than fabricate a value.

    """Options net premium flow for `ticker` — LICENSED-DATA ADAPTER SLOT.

    This is options-flow data sourced from the OPRA options tape, a licensed feed
    we do not currently hold. Per the clean-room principle we do NOT reproduce any
    competitor's proprietary options tape and we NEVER fabricate flow numbers.

    Behaviour:
      - `settings.options_flow_upstream` empty  -> return `None`
        (the router turns this into an honest HTTP 501 "adapter not configured").
      - `settings.options_flow_upstream` set     -> raises `NotImplementedError`.
        The env var alone does not wire a feed: the httpx call below is only a
        worked example, not live code. Once it's uncommented and returns the
        normalized flow dict, this branch starts serving real data.

    When/if we license our own options-flow feed, plug it in below. Example wiring
    (kept commented so no external call is made until a real upstream exists):

        # import httpx
        # async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10) as client:
        #     resp = await client.get(
