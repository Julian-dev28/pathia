"""Hyperliquid resource adapter — our OWN market-data source.

Clean-room principle: every OHLC/price series this API serves is backed by
Hyperliquid, an exchange we connect to directly. We never proxy a competitor's
API. This module is the single upstream seam for HL candle data; routers call
these coroutines and never touch the raw client.

The underlying client (`pathiel.client.hl_client.fetch_hl_candles`) is
synchronous and handles auth/SSL/rate-limiting/retries itself. It is wrapped in
`asyncio.to_thread(...)` so the async request path never blocks the event loop.
