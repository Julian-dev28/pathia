# Config audit 3 — the DSL exit engine (`dsl_exit` block + loose exit keys)

READ-ONLY audit. Scope: the entire `dsl_exit` block plus the loose exit-related top-level
keys (`loss_cooldown_min`, `min_ai_close_hold_min`, `sl_atr_mult`, `backup_sl_max_frac_of_liq`).
Live config snapshot read from `.agent-config.json`. Every key was grepped in
`pathiel/agents/dsl_exit.py` and `pathiel/agents/executor.py`
(plus repo-wide for the loose keys).

**Headline: nothing in this block is dead. Every key is read and load-bearing.**
This is the live exit engine on real money. Do not remove anything here for "cleanup."
The only safe actions are CONSOLIDATE-adjacent notes and one just-off pair to leave alone.

---

## TL;DR — removable now (safe)

**NONE.** Every key in scope is read at runtime and changes exit behavior. There is no
dead key to delete in this block.

## TL;DR — DO NOT TOUCH (load-bearing / safety-critical)

Every one of these is a stop or a profit-lock on live positions. Removing or zeroing any
of them changes how real money exits:

- `max_loss_pct` — hard spot stop (safety-critical)
- `max_loss_roe_pct` — leverage-aware ROE stop (safety-critical, this is the real cap at high lev)
- `atr_stop{enabled,atr_mult,floor_pct,ceiling_pct}` — vol-scaled Phase-1 stop width (safety-critical when enabled; it IS enabled)
- `protect_pct` — Phase-1→Phase-2 arm threshold AND the never-armed cut threshold (safety-critical)
- `retrace_threshold` — base Phase-2 give-back floor (the tight floor)
- `phase2_tiers[]` — the VALIDATED loosened give-back ladder (the MANTA +94% ride; do not flatten)
- `hard_timeout_minutes` — emergency time stop
- `stale_flat_timeout_minutes` — cut never-armed drifters to free slots
- `sl_atr_mult` — server-side backup stop distance (safety-critical, fires between DSL ticks)
- `backup_sl_max_frac_of_liq` — caps the backup stop inside the liq buffer (safety-critical)
- `loss_cooldown_min` — anti-revenge re-entry block after a loss
- `min_ai_close_hold_min` — anti-churn min hold before the AI may close

## Just-off, NOT dead — leave in place

- `breakeven_trigger_pct = 0.0` and `breakeven_lock_pct = 0.0` — both READ every tick at
  `dsl_exit.py:307`, but the whole ratchet is guarded by `if pol.breakeven_trigger_pct > 0`.
  At 0.0 the breakeven ratchet is OFF, not dead. The code path is live; setting trigger
  >0 arms it with zero code change. Keep both keys as the on/off switch for the feature.

## phase2_tiers — the Lane 3 validation (why this is load-bearing, not cosmetic)

`research/alpha_swarm/runners/influx_exit.md` (Lane 3 EXIT/ride study, n=9,587 reached-+5%
influx longs, OOS halves agree, lookahead-safe) ranks exit policies by net EV:

- The spec'd **tight floor armed at +1%** captures only **14-16%** of MFE → **+1.45-1.64% EV**.
  On the >=50% runners it captures **1.8%** of the move. That is the leak.
- **35%-of-peak give-back armed at +10%** captures **36.5%** of MFE on the >=50% bucket,
  **+31.9% EV**, uncapped — it beats even fixed-TP+30% on the tail (+31.9% vs +29.88%).
- This is exactly the MANTA case: peaked +145% ROE, closed +94% = a 35%-of-gain give-back,
  the move the live `phase2_tiers` ladder is built to ride.

The live ladder (`{pct_above_entry: 8, retrace: 0.35}`, `{15, 0.40}`) plus the tight base
`protect_pct=1.25` / `retrace_threshold=0.1` is the deliberate shape Lane 3 endorses:
**tight floor in the body (give back only 10% sub-+8%), then loosen to 35%/40% give-back
once a real move is underway.** Flattening or removing the tiers reverts to the validated
leak. Do not touch them.

`protect_pct` / `retrace_threshold` = the tight floor that protects the body before the
first tier arms. `phase2_tiers` = the loosened give-back that lets the runner run. They
are a matched pair; tune together if ever, not in isolation.

## Findings / concerns (no edits made)

1. **Config nesting is correct on the LIVE path.** The entry-time policy that every fresh
   position gets is built in `executor.py:1013-1029`, which reads the NESTED `atr_stop`
   block (`atr_mult`/`floor_pct`/`ceiling_pct`) correctly. Verified `register_position`
   is called with that policy at `executor.py:1033`.

2. **Reconcile-path inconsistency (code bug, not a config issue).** The fallback builder
   `_policy_from_config()` at `dsl_exit.py:533-560` — used to SYNTHESIZE a tracker after a
   blackout/exchange reconcile — does NOT read the `atr_stop` block at all (it omits
   atr_stop_*, so a reconciled position silently falls back to `atr_stop_enabled=False`
   and the fixed `max_loss_pct` stop). It also omits the nested mapping the executor does.
   Net effect: a position rebuilt after a blackout gets a TIGHTER fixed stop than a fresh
   entry, not the configured ATR stop. This is a correctness gap in the reconcile path,
   not a reason to remove any key. Flagging for a follow-up fix (mirror the executor's
   nested `atr_stop` read into `_policy_from_config`). Severity: medium — only fires on the
   post-blackout reconcile path, and it errs toward a tighter stop (safer, not looser).

3. **`min_ai_close_hold_min` lives outside this engine.** It is read in
   `scripts/trading_loop.py:925`, not in dsl_exit/executor. It is in scope as a loose
   exit-related key and is live (anti-churn gate on AI closes). Keep, just note its home.

4. **Default-value drift between call sites (harmless, worth knowing).** The `.get()`
   fallbacks disagree across builders: e.g. `max_loss_pct` defaults to 2.5 at
   executor.py:1013 but 2.0 at executor.py:712; `max_loss_roe_pct` defaults 50.0 at
   executor.py:1014, 40.0 at executor.py:713, 50.0 in the dataclass, while live config = 25.0.
   Because the live config sets every key explicitly, the fallbacks never fire, so behavior
   is unaffected. If a key were ever removed from config, these stale defaults would
   silently loosen the stop. Another reason the answer here is KEEP-everything-explicit.

---

## Verdict summary

- REMOVE (dead): none.
- CONSOLIDATE: none structurally; `protect_pct`+`retrace_threshold`+`phase2_tiers` are a
  matched exit-shape unit — document/tune as one, do not split.
- RECONSIDER: none of the keys; one CODE follow-up (finding 2, atr_stop missing from the
  reconcile-path policy builder).
- KEEP: every key in scope. Most are safety-critical stops on live capital.

This block is the live exit engine. The completeness move here is to leave it intact and
fix the reconcile-path atr_stop gap separately, not to prune.
