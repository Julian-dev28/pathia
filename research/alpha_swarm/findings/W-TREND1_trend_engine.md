# W-TREND1 — trend_engine build: three nulls and two data traps

Date: 2026-08-02
Code: `services/trend_engine/`, tab `/trends`, tests `tests/test_trend_engine.py`
Reproduce: `python -m services.trend_engine.run --lane {hl,updown,politics,recorders}`

The `/trends` tab was built to answer "what has the market shown in the last
week, and what does that imply for next week". Building it produced five
results worth keeping. Three are nulls; two are data bugs that would have
manufactured fake edges on a dashboard.

---

## 1. NULL — 7-day trend extrapolation has no directional edge

`services/trend_engine/forecast.py::project` is a shrunken-drift model:
7-day OLS log-slope, shrunk 0.35x and weighted by sqrt(r2 x efficiency),
capped at 1.5 sigma, with a lognormal band.

Walk-forward, 26 HL coins, 400 daily bars, **non-overlapping** 7-day anchors
(`--backtest --days 400`):

| metric | value | null | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| directional hit | 49.66% (n=1317) | 50% | −0.25σ, **no edge** |
| p50 abs error | 9.35% | 8.90% (random walk) | **worse than naive** |
| 80% band coverage | 80.4% | 80% | **calibrated** |
| split-half | 47.3% early / 52.1% late | — | **sign flips** |

Two methodology notes that changed the answer:

- **Overlapping anchors inflate significance.** At `step=2` with a 7-day
  horizon the same outcome bars are reused, and the contrarian variant looked
  like +2.9σ. On non-overlapping anchors it is +0.25σ.
- **Split-half must use the same anchor grid.** Re-running the walk on
  truncated series shifts the anchor phase and manufactures a difference; the
  implementation buckets one grid by bar index instead.

Consequence for the product: the tab shows a calibrated *band* and prints the
coin-flip verdict in amber next to the direction column. Do not build a book on
7d trend continuation without new evidence.

## 2. NULL — BTC 5m up/down is unconditionally a coin flip

6,047 windows / 21 days of Binance 1m klines, on the market's 5-minute grid,
using Polymarket's own tie rule (`close >= open` resolves UP; 0.28% of windows
are exact ties, worth ~0.3pp of base rate).

Base UP rate **49.4%** (95% CI 48.2–50.7), p = 0.37 against a coin flip.

Seven conditioning families, each Bonferroni-corrected inside itself: hour of
day, session, day of week, prior direction, prior streak, prior magnitude,
volatility regime. **Zero buckets survived correction.** Nearest miss: after an
UP window, the next window is UP 47.4% (n=2988, p_bonf 0.062) — a mild
anti-persistence that is not significant.

## 3. POSITIVE — the *in-progress* window is calibrated and the market knows it

A driftless random walk from the elapsed move plus realised 1m vol, evaluated
at minute 3 of 5:

- Brier **0.160** vs 0.25 null → 36% skill
- calibration error **1.1pp**, every reliability bin's realised rate inside its CI
- stable across lookbacks (12–288 windows) and decision minutes (1–4)

And the live book prices essentially there: repeated live reads showed the
model within ~2pp of the executable price. So the model is right and there is
no free money — which is the useful conclusion. The tab watches for the case
where the book *does* diverge past a 5pp buffer.

## 4. TRAP — `clob.polymarket.com/midpoint` disagrees with the book

Observed live: `/midpoint` returned **0.325** while the book was **0.27 bid /
0.28 ask**. Comparing a model to that midpoint produced a 17–22pp "edge" that
did not exist. Fixed by reading `/book` and pricing the side that would be
lifted (UP costs the ask, DOWN costs 1 − bid).

Related: these markets settle on the **Chainlink BTC/USD data stream**, not
Binance (read off the market description). Any model mined from Binance carries
a feed-mismatch error, so `FEED_BUFFER = 0.05` must be cleared before a
deviation counts.

## 5. TRAP — the political "mean reversion" is a shared-endpoint artifact

Correlating last week's probability change with this week's shares the t−7d
price between the two windows. Noise in that single observation enters the two
changes with opposite signs, so the correlation is negative by construction.

Same 26 political markets, 2026-08-02:

| measurement | corr | z | reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| overlapping (t−14→t−7 vs t−7→now) | **−0.22** | — | "moves overshoot and fade" |
| gapped (t−21→t−14 vs t−7→now) | **+0.18** | 0.81 | martingale, not significant |

A separate version of the same bug: Gamma lists some markets as open past their
own end date. Including them (they collapse to 0 or 1) gave corr −0.60,
z = −3.47 — a "significant" result driven entirely by expired rows.

Both are guarded: expired markets are dropped, the null test is gapped, and a
carry coefficient is only allowed into a forecast when it is significant AND
robust across a liquidity split AND measured on gapped windows AND n ≥ 25.

## 6. INFRA — a CLI entry point that skips `.env.local` reads the wrong ledger

`pathiel.agents.rebalancer_owned` freezes `_STATE_DIR` from
`PATHIEL_STATE_DIR` at import time, and that variable lives in `.env.local`.
The recorders lane first reported "2 books, 4 signals" against a tree holding
28 books, with no error anywhere — it was reading `<repo>/shadow_ledger`
instead of `<repo>/.state/shadow_ledger`. Fixed by
`services/trend_engine/env.py`, called before any `pathiel` import in
every entry point. Worth checking in any future service with a CLI.

## 7. CORRECTION — the advertised Polymarket fee is not the charged fee

Gamma's market payload for the 5m updown markets advertises
`takerBaseFee: 1000` / `makerBaseFee: 1000`. On the CLOB websocket, **79 of 79
executed trades reported `fee_rate_bps: "0"`** (2026-08-02).

This mattered: with the advertised 1000 bps and Polymarket's
`rate × min(p, 1−p) × shares` formula, a fee is up to 5¢/share, which turns any
one-tick crossed pair into a loss — the conclusion originally written here. At
the charged rate of 0, a 1¢ crossed pair is 1¢ of edge, and the only thing
standing between us and it is latency. `FEE_BPS_DEFAULT` is now 0 with the
advertised value explicitly distrusted, and `observed_fee_bps()` reads the live
rate off `last_trade_price` so the tape keeps the number honest.

Generalisable: price the fee off executions, never off the market metadata.

## 8. Latency — polling floor is geography, so stop polling

Measured medians from this machine: `gamma /markets?slug` 188 ms, `clob /book`
327 ms, `clob POST /books` (BOTH sides) 302 ms, curl-subprocess 323 ms vs
keep-alive session 297 ms. TLS handshake is not the bottleneck; RTT is.

Batching both books into one call plus caching the immutable slug→token lookup
took a quote from ~840 ms to ~245 ms. The CLOB market **websocket** takes it to
**0 ms**: 6,630 `price_change` events in 25 s for one pair, and each entry
carries `best_bid`/`best_ask` so no order-book reconstruction is needed.

## 9. TRAP — health measured in a process that exits is a permanent lie

The `/trends` arb card showed `websocket down · STALE · 0 events · reconnects 0`
for hours while the socket was fine. The status block came from the cached lane
payload, and that cache is written by `run --refresh-all`: a process that
subscribes, quotes in the same millisecond, snapshots `feed().health()`, and
exits. `reconnects 0` with an empty `last_error` was the tell — a socket that
*failed* would have retried; this one never got the chance.

Two consequences, both fixed: the cached `live_pair` was a REST read on every
refresh (`warm_feed()` now waits for both legs before quoting, 1.06s), and the
dashboard now reads socket health from `preflight()`, which runs in the
long-lived server process, tagged with `pid`. Verified after the fix: server pid
98510 reporting 7,244 events / 371 trades / `fee_rate_bps 0` on its own feed.

Generalisable: a health metric is only meaningful from the process that owns the
resource. Cache the *measurement*, never the *liveness*.

## 10. CORRECTION — the "2 sell-side prints" are one window, worth 8 cents

Re-read at n=1,126 samples / 225 windows (2026-08-03, 19h of unbiased
sampling). Both net-profitable SELL snapshots are the **same 5-minute window**
(`btc-updown-5m-1785648300`, 13:27:01 and 13:29:32), which is also the very
first window ever sampled. Nothing in the **224 windows since**.

| read | number |
|---|---|
| BUY pair under $1, net | **0 / 1056** snapshots, min pair cost $1.001 |
| SELL pair over $1, net | 2 snapshots, **1 window of 225** |
| best takeable | **$0.077** (1c/share x the 7.73-share thin leg) |
| drought | 224 windows / 19.2h |

Two things were wrong with how this was reported. The sampler takes five shots
per window, so one resting order gets counted up to five times and
`2/1056 snapshots` reads as an independent rate. And a per-share edge with no
size next to it hides that the fat leg (122.8 shares) is irrelevant — the trade
is capped by the thin one. `arb_stats` now reports `net_hit_windows`,
`best_hit_usd`, and the drought, and the verdict string leads with windows.

Against that $0.077 the sell side also has to mint a complete set on the CTF
contract and pay Polygon gas. Claim 3 is **not tradeable from here** — not
because the fee killed it (the fee is 0), but because the opportunity is one
window in 225 and worth eight cents when it appears.

### What ships from this

- `/trends` tab, four lanes, every forecast next to its own backtest verdict.
- HL lane covers crypto AND HIP-3 (`xyz:`) as separate sectors with separate
  benchmarks — SP500 for equities, BTC for perps.
- Microstructure block: the fat tail (confirmed), the both-sides arb (real math,
  latency-bound), and the price-calibration question (needs the sampler).
- CLOB websocket feed: quotes served from memory at 0 ms with a REST fallback.
- 127 gate tests, offline, <1s.
- Scheduler jobs `trends-price` (30 min), `trends-recorders` (6 h), plus the
  book sampler as its own process (`scripts/restart.sh sampler`).
- No new capital, no new book. The HL lane's honest read is: the band is
  usable, the arrow is not.

### Open, accruing

The unbiased book sampler (~288 windows/day) is the only path to answering
claim 1 (price-bucket calibration) and the tradeable half of claim 2 (buying
the cheap side near the close). At n=25 the late-ticket EV interval still
straddles breakeven. Re-read `--edges` after a few days.

**Update 2026-08-03, n=1,126 samples / 225 windows:**

- **Claim 1 — calibrated.** @60s (n=205) no price bucket sits outside its own
  interval. @30s (n=180) one does: 0.10–0.25 priced 0.169, resolved 0.321
  (+15.2pp, n=28) — one bucket out of ten at 95%, which is what noise looks
  like. No edge to trade.
- **Claim 2b — still negative.** Buy any side ≤5c with 30s left: n=122, win
  1.64% (CI 0.45–5.78%) against a 2.01% breakeven, EV/$ −0.185. The fat tail is
  real (claim 2, @120s the leader priced 0.981 resolves 0.940, n=315) and the
  book still does not pay for it at the touch.
- **Claim 3 — see section 10.** One window in 225, $0.08 takeable.

Nothing here is promotable. The sampler keeps running because claim 2b is the
only line whose interval could still move.
