"""W-FND1 — is there edge in FUNDING, where the candle space is saturated?

Every chart-pattern hypothesis this repo has tested has failed: KillaXBT range
structure, Williams patterns, session sweeps (W-SESS1), the whole main-engine
trigger stack (W-ME2). Memory's summary is that candle space is saturated. So
this tests the data that is NOT candles and IS available historically: the
perpetual funding rate.

Funding is a real, mechanical cashflow — longs pay shorts when positive. It is
positioning, not price. That makes it a different coordinate from anything
already refuted here.

PRE-REGISTERED BEFORE RUNNING. Grid fixed, every cell reported:

  universe : BTC ETH SOL BNB XRP (majors — what we trade)
  data     : 251 days of hourly funding, paginated; 1h candles aligned to it
  entries  :
    H1 crowded-long fade : funding z >= +Z  -> SHORT
    H2 crowded-short fade: funding z <= -Z  -> LONG
    H3 carry-with-trend  : funding z >= +Z  -> LONG  (does crowding persist?)
    H4 sustained-positive: funding > 0 for N consecutive hours -> SHORT
  Z        : 2.0, 3.0
  holding  : 24h
  stop     : 6%
  => 4 hypotheses x 2 thresholds = 8 CELLS. Bonferroni 0.05/8 = 0.00625.

Scored against a matched random-time null on the same coins with the same
holding rule. Bar: mean > 0 net of 25bps, BOTH OOS halves > 0, p < 0.00625.

Prior: memory records `funding_spike_short` as VALIDATED +6.2%/episode and
`neg_funding_fade` as REFUTED and ripped out. H1 and H2 are the honest
out-of-sample re-tests of those two claims.
