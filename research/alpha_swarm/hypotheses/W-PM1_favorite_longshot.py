"""W-PM1 — favorite-longshot bias on Polymarket: are longshots overpriced?

The classic prediction-market edge: markets priced at low probability (longshots) tend to
resolve NO more often than their price implies (overpriced), while favorites are underpriced.
If real, you systematically FADE longshots (buy NO on low-p markets / buy YES on high-p).

Test: pull RESOLVED markets, bin by the market's last YES price, compare the price (implied
prob) to the actual resolution rate (did YES win?). Calibration gap = the edge. Then compute
the EV of a simple rule: buy the favorite side (side priced > 0.5) at its price, hold to
resolution. Fees ~0 on Polymarket (gas only). Read-only, uses resolved outcomes as truth.
