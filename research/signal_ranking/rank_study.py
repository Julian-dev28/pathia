"""Does anything we already record predict which signal is worth a slot?

THE QUESTION, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE
------------------------------------
The books write ~32 signals a day between them. `max_concurrent` is 10 and the
holds are one day, so the system can act on about ten. It currently takes them
in the order they arrive, which means roughly two thirds of every day's signals
are discarded by a rule with no opinion: the clock.

That makes selection, not discovery, the cheapest place to find P&L. A new book
has to be researched, validated and funded. A better ranking over signals we
already generate costs one comparison and ships behind the existing gates.

So: for each live book, join every graded signal's forward return to the
features recorded alongside it, and ask whether any feature separates the good
signals from the bad. If one does, taking the top ten by that feature beats
taking the first ten by arrival, and the difference is free.

METHOD
------
Grades through the real machinery (`shadow_ledger.grade_records`), one record at
a time so each return stays joined to its own metadata. Deduplication is applied
first, exactly as the aggregate grader does it, so this study sees the same
episode set the live verdicts do.

Returns are net of funding and of 25bps slippage, matching how every book in
`dashboard._BOOKS` is quoted. Comparing a raw price return against a net-quoted
verdict is how a study talks itself into an edge that does not survive contact.

Reported per feature:
  spread      mean return of the top tercile minus the bottom tercile
  ic          Spearman rank correlation between feature and return
  p           two-sided p-value on that correlation

A spread is only interesting when the IC agrees with it. Terciles on a few
hundred points will happily produce a spread from noise, and the rank
correlation is the check that the ordering is monotone rather than one lucky
bucket.
