"""xs_reversal — short the 3-day cross-sectional winners, where funding is awake.

LIVE FROM THE FIRST BAR, by operator instruction 2026-09-04. There is no shadow
arm and no promotion ladder: the evidence was gathered before the book existed
rather than after, which is the order the doctrine asks for anyway.

THE EDGE
--------
Measured on the data_logger panel (280 coins, funding + OI + price, ~7.7
snapshots a day since 2026-06-26), quoted from the short's side and net of
funding paid and 25bps of round trip. See research/alpha_swarm/findings/
W-XSR1_cross_sectional_reversal.md for the full working.

  short top decile of 3d return          +1.373%/trade  n=5106  p 0.0000
  ... and funding awake >= 67% of 7d      +2.474%/trade  n=1995  p 0.0000

The awake filter is the part that matters and it is not a liquidity proxy:
inside the THIN half alone, awake +2.776% against dead -0.754%.

WHY IT SHOULD WORK, STATED SO IT CAN BE WRONG
----------------------------------------------
The trade is that an extended move was driven by positioning that has to
unwind. Funding only moves when longs and shorts disagree enough to pay each
other, so a coin pinned at Hyperliquid's 1.25e-05 baseline has no crowded side
to unwind and nothing to give back — which is exactly what the dead bucket
shows at -0.443%.

If that mechanism is right, the book dies when funding stops discriminating:
either the venue changes how the baseline works, or a regime arrives where the
biggest movers are driven by spot flow rather than perp positioning. The
nightly grader in autonomous_cycle.py is what catches that, and it demotes on
forward evidence without asking anyone.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE
----------------------------------
The study ranked across the whole panel. This ranks across the coins actually
visible in the live universe this cycle, which is a smaller and more liquid set.
That makes the live book's decile a subset of the tested one rather than a
superset — a narrower trade than the one measured, never a wider one.

The honest discount: the awake filter was FOUND, not predicted. It fell out of
a test of something else (H4, funding direction, which failed). Found results
earn a forward record before they earn confidence, which is what the ledger
below is for — not a shadow arm, a receipt.
