"""Multi-source news-surge recorder (worldmonitor thesis, 2026-07-21).

The `news_surge_short` book fires off a PER-COIN Google-News query. This
recorder tests whether a BROADER attention measure — a fixed pool of curated
finance/tech firehoses, entity-matched to our scan candidates — is a better
surge signal, using the exact dose-response the thesis test validated: on our
own 3,858-row news ledger, breaking-attention shorts graded +9.71%/sig (80%
win) vs +1.94% for non-breaking, a ~5x dose-response (lookahead-safe grader,
6% live stop). More/earlier attention should mean a bigger next-day move.

WHY POOL-THEN-MATCH instead of per-coin queries: it is O(feeds) not
O(coins) — fetch each firehose ONCE per pass (cached), then count relevant
headlines for every candidate against the shared pool. ~15 fetches covers the
whole universe, versus one query per coin.

ZERO CAPITAL. This only records to a new ledger (`news_surge_multi`); the
autonomous cycle grades it forward and, per the standing test->build->ship
flow, it earns a bounded $20/10x live arm ONLY if it grades EV+ AND beats the
live single-source `news_surge_short`. Records the validated SHORT side at the
live geometry (1d horizon, 6% stop) so the two ledgers are directly
comparable. Feed list: research/worldmonitor/rss-feeds-report.csv (the working
DIRECT firehoses; Google-proxied entries are dropped — we already read those).
