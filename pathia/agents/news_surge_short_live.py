"""Live wiring for the news-coverage-surge SHORT edge (inverse of the
refuted news_catalyst LONG book).

Origin (2026-07-20, operator epiphany: "reverse anything REFUTED"):
`research/alpha_swarm/findings/reverse_refuted_direction_audit.md` graded the
exact opposite side of every refuted directional shadow book through the
production grader plus a matched same-coin random-time null. Blanket reversal
failed everywhere except one cell: SHORTING a breaking Google-News coverage
surge on xyz TOKENIZED EQUITIES, +13.82%/sig (n=7, excess +11.69% over the
null, mc_p 0.0005; ex-CASHCAT-outlier +7.52%/sig on 6 pure-equity episodes,
mc_p 0.004). The non-breaking control was ALSO positive-excess — read the
finding's "attention-fade" synthesis before extending this beyond equities.

news_catalyst_live (the LONG book this inverts) was demolished 2026-07-18
(commit 8ca189f) after its own REFUTED verdict; this module restores its
coin_catalyst() read but flips the trade and narrows the live scope to what
the evidence actually supports:

- RECORD every scan candidate (crypto AND xyz equities, breaking and
  non-breaking) to the unified shadow ledger under a NEW book name
  (`news_surge_short` — never conflated with the old LONG `news_catalyst`
  ledger, which stays historical) so the broader hypothesis keeps accruing
  forward evidence even where we do not yet trade it.
- TRADE (real capital) only breaking reads on xyz: coins. The n=7 sample was
  6/7 equities and 1 crypto outlier (CASHCAT +51.7%, a single wild episode) —
  crypto surge-shorts stay record-only until they earn their own n>=8 forward
  read. This is the operator's "small positions" order implemented BOUNDED:
  the live geometry (15% stop, 1-day hard timeout, no trail) is the EXACT
  shape that was graded, so the ledger keeps grading the trade it is taking.

Operator flip 2026-07-20: $20 notional, 10x leverage (both explicit operator
numbers, not the crash_continue/engulf-family default of 12x). Mandatory
review at 8 resolved forward episodes (the grader's own min_n) — REFUTED or
EV25<0 at that bar flips shadow_only=true, no debate, same as every other
thin-evidence live flip in this file.
