    `_backup_sl_price` (and the pct-override branch in `maybe_execute`) bound the
    server-side stop to `max_frac_of_liq / leverage` of entry so it always sits
    inside liquidation. That is the right guard, but it resolves the conflict by
    SHRINKING THE STOP: a book asking for its validated 20% stop at 6x silently
    gets 0.60/6 = 10%, a materially different strategy. Measured on 51 xyz
    equities / 78 daily bars, the 10% variant forced out 33% of legs against
    3.3% at the intended stop and lost money under every sampling scheme.

    The stop is the validated parameter, so cap the leverage to fit it instead.

    `1/lev` OVERSTATES the liquidation distance, because maintenance margin eats
    into it: the real isolated liq move is `1/lev - maint`, `maint = 1/(2*coin
    max leverage)`. On a high-maxLeverage coin maint is negligible (xyz equities
    2.5%) and the two agree, but on a low-maxLeverage coin it dominates — a
    BOME-class 3x-max coin has maint 16.7%, so at 3x it liquidates at 16.7%
    while the naive rule happily authorizes a 20% stop. That is a stop OUTSIDE
    liquidation: the position dies before its exit can fire. Pass
    `coin_max_leverage` to close that hole; omit it to fall back to the naive
    (optimistic) bound.

    `liq_safety_frac` (default 0.85) is the headroom on that liq bound. 0.85
    holds every current book at the leverage it already runs (a 20% stop needs
    0.65 to keep 3x on xyz) while still capping the low-maxLeverage coins where
    the stop would otherwise sit outside liquidation. Lower it toward 0.60 to
    buy gap protection at the cost of notional: 0.60 pushes a 20% stop down to
    2x, a third less size. 0 disables the liq bound entirely.
