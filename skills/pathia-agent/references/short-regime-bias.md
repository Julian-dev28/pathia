# Funding-Regime Bias (symmetric)

Use when the user wants the bot to follow the market-wide funding regime more
strictly. The pattern is **direction-agnostic**: when the regime is
SHORT_CROWDED, longs face the elevated bar; when it flips to LONG_CROWDED,
shorts face the same elevated bar. Same code path, same thresholds, just
keyed off `funding_regime` vs `trade_side`.

## Core principle

> Enforce regime discipline by default, but never add friction to aligned
> trades.

- Trades **aligned** with the funding regime → normal bar (no friction added).
- Trades **against** the funding regime → elevated bar.
- With current live settings, `block_counter_trend_bypass=true`, so a lone
  momentumBurst/slow_burn trigger no longer rescues counter-regime trades.

Separate the "counter-regime is hard" knob (`counter_regime_min_conf`) from
the overall activity knob (`min_ai_confidence`). **Never** solve regime bias
by globally raising `min_ai_confidence` — it just kills volume.

## Implementation location

The funding-regime overlay lives inside
`pathiel/agents/risk_gates.py::market_regime_gate`. It:

1. Calls `detect_regime(ctx.coin)` for the trend regime (BTC / SP500 / own).
2. Calls `market_get_funding_regime()` (cached 5 min in
   `pathiel/agents/hyperfeed.py`) for the funding regime.
3. Computes `against_funding` symmetrically:
   ```python
   against_funding = (
       (funding_regime == "SHORT_CROWDED" and trade_side == "long") or
       (funding_regime == "LONG_CROWDED"  and trade_side == "short")
   )
   ```
4. When `against_funding`, raises the effective bar:
   - `effective_min_conf = max(counter_regime_min_conf, 0.85)`
   - `effective_min_score = 60.0` (vs default 50)
5. Binary trigger bypasses only matter when `block_counter_trend_bypass=false`;
   current live config keeps them blocked for counter-regime trades.

## Live config (`.agent-config.json`) recommended values

```json
{
  "min_ai_confidence": 0.62,
  "counter_regime_min_conf": 0.8,
  "leverage": 12,
  "equity_fraction_per_trade": 0.2,
  "block_counter_trend_bypass": true
}
```

Apply through MCP `config` or by editing `.agent-config.json` directly. Restart
the trading loop after editing the file by hand.

## Funding-regime cache

`market_get_funding_regime()` in `hyperfeed.py` is cached for 5 minutes
(`_FUNDING_REGIME_TTL_S = 300`). Funding rates settle hourly, so the regime
can't flip faster than that. Without the cache, every risk-gate evaluation
would refetch the full universe.

If you need a fresh read (e.g. operator testing a flip): clear the module
global `_funding_regime_cache` or wait out the TTL.

## Prompt template for sub-agents (Claude, hip3, etc.)

```
Current market regime: <SHORT_CROWDED | LONG_CROWDED | NEUTRAL>.

The system must follow the funding regime with high priority and SYMMETRICALLY.
Apply the elevated bar to trades AGAINST the current crowd, regardless of
direction. When the regime flips, the same logic applies in reverse — no
direction-specific hardcoding.

Requirements:

1. In a crowded regime, trades against the crowd must face a higher bar
   (close to a hard block unless the signal is exceptionally strong).
2. Trades aligned with the regime use the normal bar — never raise friction
   for aligned trades.
3. Keep broad slow-burn force behavior out of the execute path.
4. Trade frequency is secondary to regime alignment.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change max_daily_loss_usd.
- Do NOT create new bypasses just to increase trade count.
- Do NOT solve this by raising min_ai_confidence globally.

Suggested changes:
- Raise counter_regime_min_conf to 0.85 through MCP `config` or in
  `.agent-config.json`.
- Make market_regime_gate in risk_gates.py stricter for against-funding-regime
  trades (require either high confidence OR high composite score).
- Cache market_get_funding_regime so the gate doesn't refetch per call.
- Restart the trading loop to pick up code + config changes.

## Pitfalls

- **Asymmetric implementations are wrong.** Earlier drafts treated
  "short-crowded → easy shorts, hard longs" as a special case. When the
  regime flips, that logic doesn't migrate. The symmetric `against_funding`
  check covers both states from one code path.
- **Stale MCP server after a config-tool fix** — kill `pathiel-mcp-server.py`
  so the next MCP call respawns the updated handler.
- **Do not reintroduce broad slow-burn execution.** The live cleanup removed
  that path because it admitted too many weak PASS upgrades.
- **Verify regime via `market_get_funding_regime`** before assuming. The
  user explicitly asks "regime?" / "short or long?" — answer with a fresh
  tool call, not from session memory. The regime can flip; don't cache it
  in your head across sessions.
- **The aligned + funding-neutral case must still pass cleanly.** The gate
  fall-through for `regime == "neutral" and not against_funding` is the
  default path for most trades; if you add new short-circuits, preserve it.
- **Per-class funding overlay.** `market_get_funding_regime` now scans
  `get_universe(include_hip3=True)` and returns `regimes_by_class`; the gate
  applies the funding crowd for this coin's asset class. Older tests/stubs that
  omit `regimes_by_class` intentionally fall back to the top-level `regime`.
- **Test mocking gotcha.** Every test that exercises `market_regime_gate`
  must mock BOTH `market_regime.detect_regime` AND
  `hyperfeed.market_get_funding_regime`. The gate calls both, and an
  unmocked `market_get_funding_regime` will hit the live HL API during
  pytest runs — making tests order-dependent and randomly failing when
  the regime flips on the live market. Pattern:
  ```python
  from pathiel.agents import market_regime, hyperfeed
  monkeypatch.setattr(market_regime, "detect_regime", lambda c: "up")
  monkeypatch.setattr(hyperfeed, "market_get_funding_regime",
                      lambda: {"regime": "NEUTRAL", "assets": []})
  ```
  For cache-behavior tests, monkeypatch `_funding_regime_cache` to `None`
  and patch the internal `_compute_funding_regime` (not the public
  `market_get_funding_regime`, which is the cache wrapper).
