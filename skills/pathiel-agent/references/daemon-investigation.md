# Investigation: `--daemon` Flag Behavior (2026-05-22)

**TL;DR for current operation:** use `scripts/restart.sh` — it handles
stop/verify/start, logs, `caffeinate`, and status. Section below kept for
historical context on why the `--daemon` flag is a no-op.

## Problem
The standard restart command `python3 scripts/trading_loop.py --env prod --daemon` appeared to start but produced no output and the process died quickly.

## Root Cause
The `--daemon` flag and `--env` flag are **parsed but informational only** -- they have no operational effect on the process. From `scripts/trading_loop.py`:

```python
_parser.add_argument("--daemon", action="store_true")
# Later in execution:
_args, _unknown = _parser.parse_known_args()
# ... but --daemon is never actually used for any process management
```

The script loads `.env.local` manually (via direct file reading, not the argparse `--env` value) and respects `PATHIEL_SCAN_INTERVAL` env var. The loop itself is a simple `while True` with try/except + sleep.

## Correct Pattern
The trading loop has its own `while True` loop with `time.sleep(scan_interval)`
internally, but it does NOT fork to background itself. Use the project restart
script for persistent operation:

```bash
scripts/restart.sh loop
scripts/restart.sh status
```

## Key Takeaway
- `--env` and `--daemon` flags are accepted but **informational only**
- The script does NOT actually daemonize when `--daemon` is passed
- When run without backgrounding, the process dies when the terminal session ends
- Always use `scripts/restart.sh` or a proper process manager for persistent operation

## Watchdog "HUNG" re-execs are the host SLEEPING (2026-06-05)

**Symptom:** recurring `[watchdog] no progress for N s (> 600s) — HUNG; re-execing`
where N is far over 600 — seen up to **5940s (99 min)** and 1793s in one day (5×).

**Not a code hang.** The watchdog is a 60s-tick daemon thread (`scripts/trading_loop.py`
`_watchdog`). For it to report 5940s of no-progress, the *whole process was suspended* —
i.e. the MacBook went to idle/maintenance **sleep** (on battery). On wake the thread runs,
sees the wall-clock gap, and re-execs (correct self-heal). Confirm:

```bash
pmset -g log | grep -iE "Sleep|Wake|DarkWake" | tail
# look for: "Entering Sleep state due to 'Maintenance Sleep' ... Using Batt"
#           "Wake from Deep Idle ..."
```

**Impact during sleep:** no scans, no 60s DSL tick — open positions are protected ONLY by
the **server-side SL/TP trigger brackets** placed at entry. (Another reason those brackets
matter.)

**Fix:** `scripts/restart.sh start_loop` now launches `caffeinate -i -m -w $pid` tied to the
loop's lifetime (survives the in-place `os.execv` re-exec — same pid). To verify it's active:
`pmset -g assertions | grep caffeinate`. **Caveat:** `caffeinate -i` blocks idle sleep but a
closed lid on battery can still clamshell-sleep — keep on AC, or move to an always-on host
(`k8s/`, `DEPLOY.md`) for true 24/7. Do NOT "fix" the watchdog — it's working as designed.
